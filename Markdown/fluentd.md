## What is Fluentd?

Fluentd is an open-source data collector designed to unify the data collection and consumption process. It allows you to collect logs and data from various sources, process them, and route them to different destinations such as databases, cloud services, and other storage systems.

## Project Overview

In this project, Fluentd is used to aggregate and process log data from multiple sources. The main tasks include:

1. **Configuration**: Setting up Fluentd to collect logs from specified sources.
2. **Filtering**: Applying filters to process and transform the log data.
3. **Routing**: Sending the processed log data to designated destinations.
4. **Monitoring**: Ensuring Fluentd is running smoothly and efficiently.

By using Fluentd, we aim to streamline the log management process, making it easier to analyze and act on log data.
